# Elasticsearch APB

Depends on the image generated in `/images/elasticsearch` (`ruromero/es-apb-demo`) and configures an APB that will do the following:

* Generates self-signed certificates
* Configures a user to connect to using basic authentication
* The user will only be allowed to connect to its index
